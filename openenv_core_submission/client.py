    Client for the Openenv Core Submission Environment.

    This client maintains a persistent WebSocket connection to the environment server,
    enabling efficient multi-step interactions with lower latency.
    Each client instance has its own dedicated environment session on the server.

    Example:
        >>> # Connect to a running server
        >>> with OpenenvCoreSubmissionEnv(base_url="http://localhost:8000") as client:
        ...     result = client.reset()
        ...     print(result.observation.echoed_message)

        ...     result = client.step(OpenenvCoreSubmissionAction(message="Hello!"))
        ...     print(result.observation.echoed_message)

    Example with Docker:
        >>> # Automatically start container and connect
        >>> client = OpenenvCoreSubmissionEnv.from_docker_image("openenv_core_submission-env:latest")
        >>> try:
        ...     result = client.reset()
        ...     result = client.step(OpenenvCoreSubmissionAction(message="Test"))
